In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regard to properties declared as `retain` or `copy`.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end
```

If `myString` is assigned a value and later that value is released or set to `nil` elsewhere in the code (without a corresponding `release` in `dealloc`), a memory leak occurs if you don't follow proper memory management practices.  This is because the `retain` property increases the retain count of the string object, and if not balanced with a `release` (or `autorelease`), the object will never be deallocated.  Furthermore, manually managing memory in this way is error-prone.
