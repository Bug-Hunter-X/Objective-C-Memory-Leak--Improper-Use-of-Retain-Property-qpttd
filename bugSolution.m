The solution lies in ensuring that every `retain` call is balanced by a corresponding `release` call.  In modern Objective-C, Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) handles this automatically, greatly reducing the likelihood of this error.  However, understanding the underlying principles remains important even with ARC. 

**Using ARC:**

The simplest solution is to enable ARC in your project settings.  With ARC, the compiler manages memory automatically, eliminating the need for manual `retain` and `release` calls.  The corrected code would look like this:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
// dealloc is not needed with ARC
@end
```

**Without ARC (for educational purposes only):**

If you're working with a legacy project without ARC, meticulous memory management is crucial.  The correct version requires explicitly releasing the string in `dealloc`:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}

-(void)setString:(NSString*)newString{
    [myString release];
    myString = [newString retain];
}
@end
```

Note the explicit `release` in the `dealloc` method.  Always ensure that any object you `retain` is subsequently `release`d to prevent memory leaks.  A good practice is to use the setter method shown to handle the retaining and releasing of the object.
